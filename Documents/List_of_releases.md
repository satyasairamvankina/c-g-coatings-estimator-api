| 1|As an administrator, I can see an opening page showing cards with recent estimates (name, location, year, month), with the most recent estimate at the top.| | |
| 2 |As an administrator, from the opening page, I can easily create a new estimate, either by starting with the default values or by copying from an existing estimate.| | |
| 3 |As an administrator, when copying from an existing estimate, I'm redirected to the create estimate page with all fields transferred over exactly, except the unique job name, which should be the same, except with a (1) after it to make it unique.| | |

|--|--|--|--|--|
| 1|As an administrator, when creating a new estimate, I can enter:<ul><li>unique job name string</li> <li>location string</li><li>int number of square feet (default = , min = 0, mas = )</li><li> list of materials (product string, int unit cost, int coverage per sq ft)</li><li>int number of days (default = )</li><li> int hours worked per day (per worker)</li><li>int labor dollars per hour</li><li>int number of hotel rooms</li><li>int number of hotel nights</li><li>int hotel dollars per night</li><li> int food dollars per day (per worker)</li><li>int number of vehicles</li> <li> int number of miles per vehicle</li><li>float dollars per mile</li><li>list of miscellaneous costs (string desc, int dollars)</li><li> float multiplier</li></ul> | | |
| 2| As an administrator, while creating a new estimate, I can see the job cost in dollars and $/sqft while I change the entries. (Could we put this in a footer bar so as numbers change, the costs change as the user changes numbers - e.g. watch price change as sqft increases).| | |
| 3| Optional: As an administrator, I can save my after every modification (please don't make me click save - I might forget and my estimate would be lost).| | |
