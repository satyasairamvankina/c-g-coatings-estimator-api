| 1| As an administrator, when copying from an existing estimate, I want to be redirected to the create estimate page with all fields transferred over exactly, except the unique job name, which should be the same, except with a (1) after it to make it unique. | | |
| 2 |Optional: As an administrator, I want my work saved after every modification (please don't make me click save - I might forget and my estimate would be lost).| | |
| 3 | As an administrator, while creating a new estimate, I want to see the job cost in dollars and $/sqft while I change the entries. (Could we put this in a footer bar so as numbers change, the costs change as the user changes numbers - e.g. watch price change as sqft increases)| | |
